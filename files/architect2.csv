31/44 Architects,6 Osborn Street,LONDON,,E1 6TD,020 3735 7820,,www.3144architects.com,"31/44 Architects was established in 2010 by William Burges, James Jeffries and Stephen Davies. The practice name references their locations with studios in both the Netherlands (Amsterdam) and the UK (London). Their current team of ten, comprising architects and architectural assistants is predominantly based in their East London studio near Brick Lane.  The practice works on projects ranging in scale from strategic masterplanning through to smaller scale residential work. During 2015 they completed a family home in the Netherlands and a mixed-use retail and hotel building in Shoreditch, London.  Projects currently in development include refurbishing the conference facilities at The Barbican in London, apartment buildings and a further East London hotel. During 2016 they will complete a number of one-off individual new-build homes dotted around London.  Buildings are characterised by a thoughtful response to context – they are not conceived in isolation, but instead grow out of the particular conditions of each setting, resulting in buildings with an inherent connection to their site whilst ensuring that they are a close reflection of their clients’ requirements.  Careful detailing and craftsmanship of work is common to all 31/44 projects with all projects drawn, tested and coordinated with both CAD and physical models. In both London and Amsterdam they have assembled strong consultant partners with which to deliver projects ensuring they deliver economic, robust and thoughtful buildings.  They teach an undergraduate studio at Kingston University, London and are regular professional practice examiners at a number of architecture schools. Teaching has become a fundamental part of the practice; the constant articulation of ideas, observations and proposals required in the teaching studio transfers to their design studio. It is an essential discipline that continues to help define 31/44."

ABW Architects Ltd, 1st Floor 16 Cook Street,LIVERPOOL, Merseyside,L2 9RF,0151 669 1129,,www.abwarchitects.co.uk,"We are a firm of architects based in the centre of Liverpool. We believe that good design does make a difference to people; it can enhance the environment, bring people together and support change in a sensitive and constructive way. Architecture does not happen in isolation. We enjoy the process of making buildings, large or small, we value teamwork and recognise that this is essential to the success of a project. It really is about people working together.  We do understand the process of design and construction, and the importance of budgets and programme.  We look for new solutions and develop innovative ideas, but also value tradition and experience and look for the benefits in both. We have been working for a long time with the view that energy use should be minimised and recognise our responsibilities in designing new buildings or working with existing stuctures, and that we should continue to look for ways to reduce energy consumption in buildings whilst creating enjoyable places to live and work.  EXPERIENCE Our experience covers a wide range of building types, the advantage being that knowledge is transferrable. We have worked on historic buildings and we have designed new university faculty buildings and also:  - Special needs housing - Extra care housing - master planning - Faculty buildings - Lecture theatres - External spaces - Individual houses - Student accommodation - Sports facilities - Public Arts Projects  We aim to make places where people want to be. The design of buildings is often about resolving conflicting issues but also about looking for and taking advantage of opportunities that already exist. To do this we need to have a detailed understanding of the brief and also see the potential of a site or existing building. For example if rainwater needs to be stored to reduce loads on a local drain, why not design a lake that increases bio diversity, encourages wild life with new habitats and becomes an attractive feature in its own right. Buildings need to be places that are enjoyable and contribute to a quality of life. They need to be accessible, not just physically but also in terms of being inviting and breaking down barriers. They also need to provide privacy and quietness.  Buildings should respond to a site and contribute to the environment around them, the spaces between buildings are just as important as the buildings themselves."
