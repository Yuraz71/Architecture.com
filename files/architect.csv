The practice name references their locations with studios in both the Netherlands (Amsterdam) and the UK (London). Their current team of ten, comprising architects and architectural assistants is predominantly based in their East London studio near Brick Lane.  The practice works on projects ranging in scale from strategic masterplanning through to smaller scale residential work. During 2015 they completed a family home in the Netherlands and a mixed-use retail and hotel building in Shoreditch, London.  Projects currently in development include refurbishing the conference facilities at The Barbican in London, apartment buildings and a further East London hotel. During 2016 they will complete a number of one-off individual new-build homes dotted around London.  Buildings are characterised by a thoughtful response to context – they are not conceived in isolation, but instead grow out of the particular conditions of each setting, resulting in buildings with an inherent connection to their site whilst ensuring that they are a close reflection of their clients’ requirements.  Careful detailing and craftsmanship of work is common to all 31/44 projects with all projects drawn, tested and coordinated with both CAD and physical models. In both London and Amsterdam they have assembled strong consultant partners with which to deliver projects ensuring they deliver economic, robust and thoughtful buildings.  They teach an undergraduate studio at Kingston University, London and are regular professional practice examiners at a number of architecture schools. Teaching has become a fundamental part of the practice; the constant articulation of ideas, observations and proposals required in the teaching studio transfers to their design studio.

ABW Architects Ltd,"1st Floor, 16 Cook Street, LIVERPOOL, Merseyside, L2 9RF",Tel: 0151 669 1129,www.abwarchitects.co.uk,"We are a firm of architects based in the centre of Liverpool. We believe that good design does make a difference to people; it can enhance the environment, bring people together and support change in a sensitive and constructive way. Architecture does not happen in isolation. We enjoy the process of making buildings, large or small, we value teamwork and recognise that this is essential to the success of a project. It really is about people working together.  We do understand the process of design and construction, and the importance of budgets and programme.  We look for new solutions and develop innovative ideas, but also value tradition and experience and look for the benefits in both. We have been working for a long time with the view that energy use should be minimised and recognise our responsibilities in designing new buildings or working with existing stuctures, and that we should continue to look for ways to reduce energy consumption in buildings whilst creating enjoyable places to live and work.  EXPERIENCE Our experience covers a wide range of building types, the advantage being that knowledge is transferrable. We have worked on historic buildings and we have designed new university faculty buildings and also:  - Special needs housing - Extra care housing - master planning - Faculty buildings - Lecture theatres - External spaces - Individual houses - Student accommodation - Sports facilities - Public Arts Projects  We aim to make places where people want to be. The design of buildings is often about resolving conflicting issues but also about looking for and taking advantage of opportunities that already exist. To do this we need to have a detailed understanding of the brief and also see the potential of a site or existing building. For example if rainwater needs to be stored to reduce loads on a local drain, why not design a lake that increases bio diversity, encourages wild life with new habitats and becomes an attractive feature in its own right. Buildings need to be places that are enjoyable and contribute to a quality of life. They need to be accessible, not just physically but also in terms of being inviting and breaking down barriers. They also need to provide privacy and quietness.  Buildings should respond to a site and contribute to the environment around them, the spaces between buildings are just as important as the buildings themselves."

Alma-nac Collaborative Architecture,"11 Waterloo Court, 10 Theed Street, London, SE1 8ST",Tel: 020 7928 2092,www.alma-nac.com,"Recently selected by Wallpaper* as on of the top 20 emerging practices from across the globe, Alma-nac is a London-based studio that emerged in 2010 out of a desire to focus on construction rather than paper architecture. There was a yearning to ask open questions and to go back to first principles. The founding partners – Chris Bryant, Caspar Rodgers and Tristan Wigfall – are also keen on design as having a role in making something worthwhile out of an unlikely starting point like a difficult site or unusually small space. This investigative attitude goes hand in hand with Alma-nac’s interest in research-based architecture and in using temporary structures and installations as way to explore our environment. Arup invited Alma-nac to do just this as part of the BEL Installation for their headquarters in London. The result was a fresh look at this major engineering firm’s own office both from a social as well as an environmental perspective. Alma-nac‘s built work includes commissions for creative and forward-thinking individuals from the music industry, publishing and politics. On each project, the architects touch on themes that have a real resonance in the profession and our experience of places. Slim House in Clapham, London is an example of this type of innovative use of a pocket-of-space that only became valuable through insightful design. The project led onto fresh thinking about micro-living and the practice is currently working on two multi-unit housing projects that further explore the notion of compact homes. A distinctive aspect of the working methods at Alma-nac is the use wit together with direct engagement with the public and the design community as a sounding board for their work. To this end, the studio has been actively involved in setting up groups and events such as BOW DIY, Free Architecture and Guerilla Tactics."

Having said the above, you may be surprised at how reasonable my fees are. I appreciate the importance of good communication at every stage of a project, from the first steps of knowing your real needs, to determining a solution and then to leading you through the ever increasing maze of rules, regulations, legislation and approvals. This equally applies to visual communication and to this end, I work primarily in 3D software which enables me to produce perspective images of design solutions which are easily understood."

BiBO = better in, better out.  The ‘better’ that we put in at BiBO is based on 3 simple ideas: Curiosity, Integrity & Joy.   Curiosity: We see the world as it could be, not as it is.   Buildings (should!) last a long time; our work is a contribution to that future world. We design buildings to be sustained; inherently fit-for-purpose, well-organised, helpful, and affordable. That’s our definition of ‘sustainable design’  We promise to always question whether there is a cheaper, simpler, nicer, better way.  Integrity: “If I wouldn’t want to live/work/learn/play there myself, I won’t draw it”.   That’s the challenge we’d like to lay before ANYONE who is responsible for drawing buildings. It’s the challenge we set ourselves.   Why? Because we know that someone else has to live with what we design, and that someone might be our friends or even our kids.  Joy: Life is short, enjoy it  We’ve learned that we do our best work when we are happy.  When we’re happy, we’re engaged. When we’re engaged, we’re better at communicating and more excited about our work. When we’re communicating and excited about our work, our clients are happy.  We are completely agile. We are not constrained by an office or by 9-5 Monday-Friday. When and where we work is based on the need of the project.

We believe that good design is allied closely with the process of making and craftsmanship: the quality of any built form depends greatly on clear, well-communicated design ideas.  Although our team has a high degree of experience in different sectors, we do not approach projects with pre-conceived concepts. Instead, we enjoy working collaboratively with our clients, specialist consultants and the wider public; we fully appreciate that good ideas may not be our own. In this way, we often find that project briefs will evolve to open up new opportunities not conceived of at the outset.  We use Archicad BIM software on all our projects, supplemented with 3d printed models and hand-drawn sketches to communicate our ideas throughout. This is an iterative process of feedback and refinement, and at all stages the design proposals are tested against the project brief and set parameters such as cost, flexibility, and client aspiration. Design proposals are tailored closely to ensure the right level of specification for the project budget.  Under-pinning all of our work is a concern for the sustainability of the environment and the ability of any development to flex with the changing needs of its users. Good environmental design achieves the comfort of its occupants with minimal means, and this may entail passive design solutions, highly performing fabric specification or renewable technologies. chadwickdryerclarkes’s team has a wide range of knowledge in delivering BREEAM ‘Excellent’ rated buildings in this regard.  We can provide a full design service from RIBA stages A to M, and we have proven experience in administrating traditionally-procured contracts and working closely with contractors as part of a ‘Design-&-Build’ team. Our typical project values range from £200k to £10m."

CZWG Architects LLP,"17 Bowling Green Lane, Islington, LONDON, EC1R 0QB",Tel: 020 7253 2523,www.czwg.com,"CZWG Architects LLP is a London-based architectural practice. Founded in 1975 by Nicholas Campbell, Rex Wilkinson, Roger Zogolovitch and Piers Gough, the ethos of the practice has always been based on strong design flair and good practical, economic sense.  CZWG developed a skill in the transformation of existing buildings in terms of both function and appearance. This ability to re-interpret and rejuvenate the past seeded CZWG’s major contribution to a new era of modern architecture.  With the regeneration of London’s Docklands, the practice grew into a substantial studio with a reputation for attractive and innovative high density housing — best known for buildings such as China Wharf, a bold red seven storey riverfront scheme flanked by listed warehouses, and Cascades on the Isle of Dogs; twenty storeys and built at a time when high-rise was still discredited as a form in which to live.  In 2006 CZWG formed a Limited Liability Partnership. A strategy that has enabled the practice to embark on a wide range of projects that have extended our skills and kept the practice lively and growing.  CZWG’s Clerkenwell studio now boasts an established team of over sixty. The management team of eleven partners and nine associates are responsible as much for upholding CZWG’s long-standing commitment to our contextual design philosophy, as for the firm’s reputation for an inclusive and collaborative way of working.  The prolific output of CZWG’s built work covers a broad spectrum of development including masterplanning and urban regeneration, residential and mixed use, education, retail and leisure, workspace, arts and community and public spaces.  The practice does not have a pre-defined design ethos. Philosophical and stylistic preconceptions do not limit our approach. Each project is an imaginative and innovative response to context.  After forty years pioneering housing typologies regarded as commonplace today, CZWG continues to develop innovative and memorable architecture within which it is a pleasure to live or work."

Our clients include private enterprises, government bodies and local community groups who create iconic environments. Our ethics are to create a positive environment which translates into profitability for our clients and a lifestyle for the users.   Our work focuses around 4 principles of creating designs for people, places, properties with passion.  Designs for People We design high-quality memorable spaces and strive to create environments that evoke powerful emotions and uplift the human spirit.  Designs for Places Using materials that are second nature to the site, we develop an identity, a fervour that lingers with its users. Fit for purpose, such places promote the client’s brand.  Designs for Properties We feel properties are a composition of complimentary buildings and landscapes. Being a multi-disciplinary practice, we create holistic designs with an energy that sinuously follows between the two.   Designs with Passion We obsess about the quality of the space that we create; it personifies our ‘thought leadership’ approach and resists the temptation of a preconceived formula.

It takes into account the environment, its past and its potential. Architecture is an association between people and their surroundings. It arises from ideas, enthusiasm, meetings, exchanges, listening.  Being involved in the brief: Before starting a sketch, we are deeply interested in developing the brief to create a project where spaces will become “improved spaces”, with natural light, views, buffer areas, breakout spaces, gardens, places to bump into each others or to cut ourselves off…  Moreover we quickly define a bespoke financial envelope for every approach that sets the borders of the project.  Giving an added value: If, in every project, functionality is required, we seek special attention in all our creations. For us, creating spaces is giving a specific touch, relevant and inspiring, that will leave you happy to walk into the construction and that will increase the range of the establishment which is likely to be more frequented thanks to its design.  Developing a sustainable approach: We are at cross-roads between a project of society and its development. The choice of renewable energy and eco-buildings material is fundamental for local development, health, lifespan, legacy to the next generations. We are connected with a network of thinkers, engineers and builders able to give a large place to sustainable concepts: wood constructions, cellular bricks, natural insulation, passive architecture, heating choices involved with their surroundings, management of the solar contributions..."

Working in a way that meant the quality and function designed into a building from the outset is still there at the end.  Mahmood works closely with clients: sharing solutions that may not always result in new construction; founding like-mindedness, being there to earn confidence and trust.

Ample time then, to carefully distill the best of that financially driven design ethos and, through the medium of a small specialist consultancy, promote and deliver its substantial benefits to a new broader audience and an increasingly investment-savvy property public.   The practice’s extensive range of experience covers a wide variety of procurement sectors including domestic & commercial residential, retail architecture & strategy, manufacturing & logistics, healthcare, corporate & office, master-planning, and of course multi-disciplinary mixed use development.  The product may vary, but Far North’s ethos and approach to design and procurement will always remain the same....

On each project journey Far North offers a highly specialized bespoke service.  Our objective is to understand the nature of your business, organisation or property portfolio as thoroughly as the brief itself.  In this way, an efficient and proactive design process can lead to an exemplary architectural solution that goes way beyond satisfying the requirements of the initial project requirements…   A more holistic design approach that is all about the spirit of free-thinking and the ability to think laterally..."

We have considerable experience in tackling complicated and challenging design problems from site conditions to planning negotiations which can often stall projects in their early stages.

Working predominantly in the public sector, we seek to elevate common materials and systems to the enchanting, and employ the seemingly everyday and banal in a challenging, imaginative manner.  Our proposals draw form from their location, using references such as material, scale or rhythm to inform and reinforce the permanence and relevance of our ideas.  Fleet design buildings to add a new layer to the palimpsest of the village, town, park or city, adeptly making use of historical reference to celebrate the identity of a location without resorting to pastiche.  Our buildings are designed to be used: lived in, worked in and healed in.

Big thinking leads to large scale plans, but we also work on small scale interstitial urban projects, that bring significant benefits and are important catalysts for larger scale change, leading to the delivery of iconic places and exploring the opportunity of the meanwhile project to inform long term strategies.  We genuinely believe that local people are experts for their area and can inform design and propositions through their engagement with the social and economic and cultural life of a neighbourhood, through first hand observations shared with us and through the commitment to the long term success of a place."

From their office in St John's Wood they have extended their range throughout London and beyond to Bath in the west and and Winchester in the east.  Inevitably residential work in London has involved the practice in working with historic buildings  such that their natural inclination to push contemporary design to the limits has been tempered by the reality of integrating the work within an historic context to the evident satisfaction, not only of the their Clients, but also the notoriously difficult local Planning and Heritage Officers.   Both of the directors have a solid background working for large design lead architectural practices in London, which has instilled automatic control of all aspects of the construction process as second nature. This allows them to concentrate on looking after their Client's every need from inception through design development to completion and for the duration of this process no one cares more about the project than they do.  One or other of the Directors will personally control all aspects of each and every project so that they can nurture and develop a strong relationship with each Client. Through this process they have learnt what their Clients expect from them, and in return they have learnt to encourage their Clients involvement and to respect their aspirations. Some of their best work has been in direct response to enthusiasm from their Clients.  This enthusiasm and the loyalty of their  Clients has enabled them them to branch out into other areas of work so that the office has flourished and expanded into retail and office design work, to compliment the houses.  Whatever the project, their architectural background is reflected in their emphasis on creating and lighting space with the multitude of design details built around this central theme.  Nevertheless the basis of their success remains their dedication to Clients who want a high standard in design as well as an excellent service and full satisfaction."

Hampshire Architect,"96 New Road, Netley Abbey, Southampton, SO31 5BS",Tel: 02380 562719,www.hampshirearchitect.com,"You probably have a strong idea of what you want to achieve from your project, whether it be a development of new homes, a renovation project or a larger sunnier kitchen. By listening and working with you, we can help you get the most from your construction project and will often see opportunities that may otherwise be missed; adding real value to your project.  All too often, people go ahead with costly building work and miss valuable opportunities to add value that an architect could have guided them with.  Light and space are the most important commodities in any building, particularly a home, and poorly thought out building work can often make a space feel gloomy or badly planned. This is where HampshireArchitect comes in.   About Us We are a small enthusiastic and friendly practice, specialising in home design, renovation, remodelling, sustainable and listed buildings. Our principal architect, Carolyn Gillians, is registered with the Architects Registration Board (ARB) and chartered with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Carolyn describes her career below :    ""At the age of fourteen, I spent my school work-experience with Lyons+Sleeman+Hoare Architects in Camberley, who inspired me to begin my career in architecture. With the exception of a fascinating exchange to Vienna and the Ukraine, I carried out my studies locally at the University of Portsmouth and qualified as an architect in 2002.  Locally I have worked for Parnell Design Partnership in Havant, PRP Architects in Southampton and Martin Critchell Architects and Joanna Jefferson Architects in Chichester.  I have also worked in London and spent six months working in New Zealand, during a sabbatical travelling the world.  As a result, I have designed and managed a wide variety of projects from small domestic projects to large commercial and retail schemes; from modern contemporary buildings to listed stately homes.    This background has given me many skills, from design to technical construction detailing; from working with planners and building inspectors to learning how to really listen to clients. These skills have been invaluable in setting up HampshireArchitect"".   Testimonials ""Carolyn really listened to what we said then came up with great ideas that suited us and that we wouldn't have thought of without her"". David and Katrina, West Sussex    ""Hampshire Architect helped me through the daunting construction process and I'm delighted with the results"". Deborah, Hampshire"

Once appointed for the planning stage, haus arrange the site survey, develop a Client’s brief, prepare design concepts, develop these into CAD drawings, calculate an accurate cost estimate and when the Client is happy with both the design and cost, prepare and submit the planning application.  Following successful planning permission, haus offer a fixed-price design and build contract for the entire construction stage, including technical design, off-site fabrication and on-site erection, internal fit-out of services, finishes and fittings and landscaping where required.  Clients can rely on haus to project manage their build efficiently, co-ordinating all the interfaces between specialist German and English sub-contractors to achieve a unique building, ready to move into on time and within budget."

ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY  The architect’s and builder’s fundamental role resides in the root word of ecology “oikos”, Ancient Greek meaning “House”. The builder brings order to the environment by creating the House, a shelter to nurture the family or community.  Mutual interaction of the members within the community gives rise to our modern perception of “ecology” as the complex interconnection of human activity with the other life forms and habitats of planet Earth. We have embraced the idea of the ‘House’ as a “machine for living in”. Yet this promising ‘enfant terrible’ grew up to be an ecologically dysfunctional gas-guzzler. Now environment-conscious clients, architects, builders and engineers seek to recreate OIKOS the ‘house’.  We would give to it the practical intelligence of a cyborg, but the ecological connectedness of an organism."

THINKING - Each client and building is different so we do not produce ‘stock’ designs.We develop projects from first principles fitting a specific brief to a specific space. Lateral thinking is always required to ensure the suit fits perfectly.  MAKING - We are ‘makers’ used to fabricating our own models, prototypes and mock-ups. This gives us a good understanding of the nature of materials and develops our detailing skills.    DESIGNING - Concept and vision are crucial to form a narrative for the design process, pulling the threads together. The good design we strive to produce should always combine utility with delight.   PRESENTING - Describing the proposed design solutions in an understandable way is key to project success. We endeavour to communicate accurately and succinctly to ensure clean sign-offs.   DRAWING - Cost certainty and buildability rely on well produced tender and production information. Our documentation is always comprehensive and delivered to the agreed deadlines.   BUILDING - We prefer to stay close to the construction process as this maintains a constant learning loop. Projects on site always throw up detailed challenges which we tackle pro-actively."

We give each commission, whether large or small, the attention necessary to unlock its potential and are unwilling to let a project go until it stands as an example of design excellence. We do not think of ourselves as specialists, except in the pursuit of good architectural design. This approach requires care to understand a brief, a Client's situation and a wider context - social as well as physical. The projects develop by building a conceptual framework around the brief and co-ordinating the contributions of others. Our work is in drawing, modelling, writing about and discussing openly the results of an evolving investigation.  We are often trying to create connections between the building and the wider site, an arrangement that enhances both. For our Clients the benefits of investing in such a design process are a lasting quality to a completed project, better prediction of costs and a more certain delivery. We are excellent communicators and willing to speak at meetings and stand up at events in explanation of a scheme and support of an approach we believe in.

Being an RIBA chartered practice with 14 years of experience behind us, we allow clients to focus on the excitement of their project, leaving us to lead and navigate the process. Beyond the client’s demands, as a practice we aim to balance functionality and playfulness in spaces, ensuring our architecture is enduring and valuable for future generations. As a practice we have a particular interest in – and experience in – designing Passivhaus schemes, as part of our drive to integrate sustainable design and materials into each of our projects.  Who we work with  We work closely with developers and private clients on a variety of commercial and residential projects, right from brief to build. Our portfolio includes a diverse range of projects, including new-builds with difficult planning and sustainability targets, refurbished listed properties, and interior fit-outs of commercial spaces. Regardless of scale, InsideOut uses considered detailed design to create places that reflect the client’s lifestyle and personality, using constraints such as planning and budget as an opportunity to create spaces that are an expression of what matters most to them.  How we do it  Client liaison is paramount and each project has a dedicated Project Director and a chosen Project Architect throughout. We suggest that each appointment is drafted to the specific needs of a project following an initial appointment with us.  We can help source suitable specialist consultants for planning, structure, 3D modelling and cost management – if or when your project requires it. Your Architect’s role goes beyond just design and offers guidance throughout the process on all aspects of the build, alleviating the need to deal with consultants and contractors daily. As a result, the client can enjoy the process rather than be overwhelmed by it, and whether the client chooses to be heavily involved or not, our site reports enable them to track and comment on progress.  Once on site, InsideOut’s established relationship with contractors ensures smooth project delivery, and the practice is particularly proud of its track record in designing and delivering projects on time and on budget."

We have deep respect for historic buildings, for the culture and tradition of building and the work that’s gone on before us and we respect the people whose values are embedded in older buildings. This principle allows a clear values system in which contemporary elements resonate with the retained structures and fabric.

Morris+Company,"Unit 7, 16-24 Underwood Street, LONDON, N1 7JQ",Tel: 020 7566 7440,https://morrisand.company,"Duggan Morris Architects has been recognised as one of the leading emerging practices in the UK.  We have won multiple industry awards for our completed, and unrealised work and much of this success stems from a belief in an extensive, engaged and active exchange between the disciplines of architecture, art, design, and urbanism. Our most successful built projects have always benefitted from our integrated and collaborative approach where the design team, client, and end users, all have an encouraged part to play.  Of note is our renovation of a 1960’s Brutalist building in Highgate, which won the Manser Medal in 2011. The objective of the RIBA Manser Medal has always been to encourage innovation in house design, to show how social and technological ambitions can be met by intelligent design and to produce exemplars to be taken up by the wider house building industry.  We have also been the recipients of four RIBA Awards and an RIBA Regional Award won between 2010-2012 for a range of very different buildings; a sheltered housing scheme in Hillingdon, a commercial refurbishment for a nationally recognised developer, an extensive house renovation for an Architect, a significant extension to an agricultural building, and a new build house.  In 2012, the practice were recipients of the Stephen Lawrence Prize (Kings Grove) for the best UK project constructed for under £1million, and were once again shortlisted for the Manser Medal (Old Bearhurst). We have won numerous international design competitions including the Mersey Observatory (2009), the Waterworks (2009), the Shelters at Bexhill-on-Sea (2010), a collaboration for a new canal side regeneration scheme for a derelict site in Brentford (2011), a further collaborative entry for a housing scheme on the Tybalds Estate for Camden (2012) and more recently the Architecture Foundation Floating Cinema (2012) competition.  Our eagerness to participate, to learn and to grow has thus been a defining influence on the development of the practice, and our expanding portfolio of high quality work has been recognised by the Architect of the Year Awards as finalists in a number categories in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 with a notable runner’s up position for Young Architect of the Year in 2009.  Duggan Morris Architects designs original, tailored buildings, encompassing a broad spectrum of locations, typologies and sectors for many clients. We view every project as a means to engage fully with the practice ethos.   Our buildings are defined by the context within which they sit, whether a one off dwelling or a multiple unit regeneration scheme, we seek the qualities of the surrounding site context as a foundation for the new building insertion. Much of our work is located in the urban fabric which has become an influence on the evolution of our architectural approach and language; thus the ‘context’ within which our work sits, is the ‘thing’ which defines it.   Processing context requires careful and skilful management. We need to recognise and decipher what information is relevant in any given situation, what information is applicable to each context, and respond accordingly. This very act, of acknowledgment and understanding, creates the specificity which we believe to be so important for each project.  We are acutely aware of our responsibilities to the city within which we live, and to be part of the cycle of growth and regeneration; part of a continuum, creating relevance where perhaps there was none, and enhancing areas where there is.   We are fascinated as much by the cultures of contemporary ‘global’ and ‘local’ society as we are by the historical teachings of architecture and art. As such our work illustrates an interest in the rapid evolution of information technology and modern methods of construction, as well as the qualities of ‘craft’ and ‘tradition’. Our buildings are simple to read, elegantly conceived and above all detailed with understanding, technical prowess and sophistication.  Above all, we are passionate about the role inspiring design has to play in our lives."

Established in 2005 by Michel Mossessian, our experienced multi-cultural team is committed to architecture which adds cultural value and benefits society beyond buildings.  VISION If we were sitting with you round a table with a glass of water on it, everyone would agree that the thing they could see was a glass of water.  You could call this a unified vision because, from wherever they are sitting, everyone can see the same object.  This should be the starting point for any design process. To get to that point, we listen to each point of view – the client's, investors', engineers', scientists', to those speaking on behalf of the environment, politics, the local authority and the city planners, assessing and then reflecting all their needs in our scheme, as clearly as the water in the glass.  Importantly, this is also what the end users would see.  A common complaint is that the initial proposal and completed building are two entirely different animals. Planners and local communities, contractors and the construction industry will be consulted post proposal and compromise the scheme.  We work it the other way round so that the proposal is only completed once we have nailed down everyone’s needs.  Then we stick to them, sealing them into what we call our BLACK BOX process."

Nick Willson Architects Ltd,"g2 Hoxton works, 128 Hoxton Street, London, N1 6SH",Tel: 020 7012 1674,www.nickwillsonarchitects.com,"Nick Willson Architects is a young, London-based architectural practice, established by Nick Willson in January 2010.  For us, architecture is storytelling, as we evolve a first sketch into a finished building – the client is central to this process and we build the narrative together. This way our projects can be rich, individual and soulful and every building can be imbued with its own warmth and unique character.  Our philosophy allows us to create something special for each client, whether this means a framed view, the scent of herbs through an open window or the shadows cast across a surface.  The story begins with the client’s needs – from the basic facts of a brief to their hopes for the project, which can be harder to define. We get to know our clients, we spend time understanding what they like and dislike, their passions and interests, and from this we develop a concept. We often find it useful to provide a graphic diagram of the brief to illustrate the ideas visually.   Once we have the outline of the narrative, we use sketches to explore the concept and develop the story into a more tangible piece of architecture. At this stage we also integrate the wider influences from our detailed site analysis, such as context, solar path, wind, views, cost, programme and statutory requirements.   Following an intense period of sketching, we consolidate our ideas into a few options, which are drawn and modelled, both physically and digitally. We present progress to the client at each stage and test any revisions to the original plans, before construction and completion of the final building.   The principles of sustainability and craft are integral to our approach. Architecture should be enriching,  beautiful and purposeful. Equally, it must be sustainable and well-crafted – the design of buildings must consider the long-term impact, both on the landscape and for users.  In addition to running a young practice, Nick Willson sits on the RIBA Council and the RIBA Professional Services board.  He is also part of the Building Futures group and acts as the RIBA BIM knowledge champion.  Through these professional affiliations, Nick hopes to have a wider influence on architectural practice in the UK and act as an advocate for young architects and practices on an international stage."

From the conversion of an 1802 Martello Tower into a private house, to the transformation of a tired 1960’s office building into contemporary apartments on London’s Oxford Street to the 21st century re-imagining of a Victorian warehouse for the Turnmill building in Clerkenwell; each project is shaped by a rigorous investigation of the particularities of people and place.    At the heart of the studio’s ethos is the concept of “designing through making”.  A digital fabrication centre and the studio’s own workshops provide a testing ground for new ideas, whilst collaborative relationships with artists and makers continually invigorate the studio.  The studio’s work regularly attracts awards and industry accolades. Listed in the Observer Hotlist and the recipient of RIBA Awards, the MIPIM Future Projects Sustainability Award, Piercy&Company has also been nominated for both the Stephen Lawrence Prize and Manser Medal."

We work closely with our clients at every stage – from that initial conversation, through construction and beyond.

A deep interest in both the theoretical and practical side of architecture is at the heart of the practice. Each design is individual and derives from circumstances specific to that particular project including context, history, brief, experience and research.  Lengthy discussion forms the starting point for all projects and an ability to listen and to ask the right questions informs key decisions through the project lifecycle.  The aspiration is to create innovative solutions that respond to the context and qualities of site, are enriched by an inclusive and considered design process and react to timeframes and budget.

Our thinking is Modern - in that it represents the present day, and we draw our influences from Modernism.  However, unlike the Modernists, we don't believe that all new technology renders the old style of buildings obsolete, rather that we should look back at technology historically, returning where appropriate to simple principles, particularly those that make a building more sustainable.   We believe in simplicity and clarity of form, and in an absence of clutter.  We tend to emphasise the materiality of the building, the geometry of form and the functionality of the plan.  Elegance is synonymous with grace, taste, dignity, flair, style, dash and chic.  Our buildings embody these qualities. Our buildings are sustainable;  their designs follow the principles of economic, social and ecological sustainability.  Our designs support the development of renewable energy sources. We are the table around which ideas develop into buildings."

Reiach and Hall believe in a simplicity and clarity of approach that will achieve the client’s objectives in the most direct and appropriate manner.    Working from the outset within the constraints of brief, site, budget and time-scale, which assists with affordability and practicality, Reiach and Hall believe that this approach also realises elegant and refined buildings.    Reiach and Hall enjoy the consultation and building processes as much as the consideration of materials and construction, and as Scottish architects they are acutely aware of their unique location as generators of ideas.  Reiach and Hall’s principal design aim is to make sure that the high-quality thinking behind the conceptual approach is translated into the building.  All designs are subject to review at each main stage in a process which is controlled centrally by the directors."

We believe in the Architect as Master Builder and thrive in creating innovative solutions to design; embracing making as an integral process of development.

sixfootstudio LLP,"Studio 5C, Thane Works, Holloway, London, N7 7NU",Tel: 020 7700 5126,sixfootstudio.london/,"Our name draws its inspiration from the classic measure of man described by Vetruvius. For us, its use describes a studio philosophy driven by the relationship between humans and the spaces they inhabit.   First and foremost, it’s about more than finding dynamics and beauty in the proportions of form and space; it’s fundamentally about the quality of ‘haptic’ feedback that humans garner via all their senses from the surrounding built environment: light, shadow and proportion are brought together with one’s sense of scale; acoustics, touch and even aroma, all contribute to one’s sense of place and self.  Form follows feeling…  For us, architecture is about a preoccupation with the qualities of space; to protect, to nurture, to excite, to inspire. To feel.  We live in the age of ‘big data’ with extensive client groups and complex project requirements bringing together architecture, identity, knowledge and culture.  Close collaboration with specialists is essential to achieve the most successful project outcomes; outcomes in which physical buildings may only be a small part.  We don't seek to reinvent the wheel, but we always ask if there’s a better solution to a problem or, indeed whether the right questions have been asked.   We remain focused upon the client’s vision and lead the creation of outstanding solutions.  We push ourselves. We galvanise our collaborators.  We challenge our clients.  We work hard.

The rare opportunity to create a unique space for living or working is invested with a highly charged significance at an almost primeval level; it is absolutely essential that their architect can interpret their ideas and vision correctly and then deliver this on time, to budget, to an agreed quality.  And the architect is expected to add a further dimension – the ‘Wow!’ factor – enhancing the client’s vision and bringing clarity of form and structure to what may just be a series of ideas.  Even if that part goes well things can go wrong if the architect fails to engage effectively with the building team.  Instead of an enjoyable synergy some clients watch a battle for supremacy – with endless delays and mounting costs.  For this reason we describe our mission as providing ‘serviced design’.  Our aim is to make the client centre stage.  As part of this philosophy we always seek to offer a ‘one stop’ service and price for the whole project, design and construction costs.  This involves working with contractors we trust and know can deliver quality with integrity.  Whereas not all clients want this, for many this is ideal.  We want their project to be an epic journey of discovery that they will enjoy and recall with fondness.  We work hard on the relationships at every level.

His post-graduate studies led to an RIBA South Region Award for outstanding design work, as well as being nominated for the RIBA Silver Medal.  The practice specialises in high quality contemporary architecture, with a strong focus on the design and delivery of unique homes and one-off houses.  Our approach to architecture is not superficial or purely for effect. As a practice, we seek foundation in the basics of human life (the client) and nature (the site/ environment). This inspires our designs and how we create spaces. Through a continuous and careful dialogue with structure, details, material and order, we seek a holistic and tectonic approach in realising the architectural ideas.  Technology permits our architecture, but our architecture is not defined by it. Instead it helps us to build efficiently in a way that is integral to the architecture as well as being sustainable.

We develop the project along the guidelines set out by the RIBA through work stages that ultimately lead to construction and completion.  Through the various work stages of the project, we liaise with the local authority and consultants in seeking approvals and administer the construction process to ensure the design intent is realised in the built scheme."

Urbane Design Ltd,"Urbane Design Ltd, Unit 14.1.02, 10 Barley Mow Passage, London, W4 4PH",Tel: 020 8996 0601,www.urbanedesignarchitects.com,"At Urbane Design we have a passion for translating clients needs, lifestyles and budgets into designs that are inspirational and practical.   Our ethos is one of completely understanding our client’s requirements and sensitively translating these into designs of exceptional quality, through dialogue and attention to detail.   To produce quality, we hope to be actively involved with each project from the earliest stages.  Specialising in residential architecture, we deliver projects across London and the South East. Our experience spans new-build homes and apartments as well as remodelling existing properties and extending properties via loft conversions, rear extensions, side returns and basement conversions.   Whether you are a developer looking to create new properties or a householder looking to extend an existing property, we have a team of professionals with unrivalled knowledge and a rigorous design and management process that ensures every project is characterised by inspiring design, attention to detail and budget management.  Services offered include design, planning applications, building control applications, project management, contract administration, interior design and surveying.   Approach Every project we undertake whether it is a home extension, a new build home or a mixed use residential scheme follows the same rigorous process at Urbane Design. Our design and project management process is always centred around the customer and communication is central to all stages of the project to ensure projects are delivered on time, on budget and to the highest standards.  We offer a flexible approach to using our services allowing you to select the level of service that you feel appropriate however a typical project will take you from the brief stage through to initial designs, statutory consents and project management.   Services  We recognise that different projects and clients require different levels of service which is why we have developed two methods of delivering architectural services. We would be very happy to discuss the different options available and help you choose which is right for your particular project.  Fully managed service  With this method of service we will be with you throughout the process from initial concept design stage through to the completion of your project build. We will act as the main coordinator of your project ensuring everything runs smoothly and any issues or problems are navigated and brought to a satisfactory conclusion. As part of a fully managed service we will typically prepare your designs, deal with your local authority to get the necessary consents, prepare a schedule of works to allow accurate quotes from builders, handle building regulations submissions and deal with contractors to ensure the build stage progresses smoothly.  Modular service  For those clients who would like the input of an architect but would like the flexibility to choose the level of input, our modular service can be a way to achieve this. Our modular solution breaks down the stages into initial concept design, statutory consents and build stage costing documents enabling clients to choose the service that meets their project requirements and budget.  Choosing the right level of service needs careful consideration and we would be happy to discuss your project and the right level of service and associated costs.  Needs analysis  Whether you are a developer looking to build apartments or a homeowner looking to carry out a loft conversion or kitchen extension, our thorough needs analysis process aims to get a detailed understanding of your requirements as well as a detailed understanding of the site and property. This forms the basis of the brief from which the initial concepts are developed.  If you are a homeowner looking to extend an existing home or build a new home we will gather relevant information about what you are hoping to achieve, your lifestyle and your budget. For developers we will gather information about the type of scheme, target market and the financial aspects of the project. This information forms the basis of the brief that the architect will use to create initial designs.  Initial design  At Urbane Design we believe that unlike the traditional approach to architecture, this important design stage should be carried out as an interactive session. Your input into the design is encouraged so that you fully understand the process and can make informed choices.   For homeowners looking to carry out extension or remodelling works to an existing property this initial design stage will be done in your home allowing us to provide sketch designs and inspiration in response to your input.  Planning permission  As part of the design process we will establish whether you need planning permission or for homeowner projects, if your work can be done under permitted development. Urbane Design has a great deal of experience submitting planning applications and has strong history of successful outcomes with Local authorities. Obtaining planning permission can be one of the main challenges when embarking on a project whether it is a kitchen extension or loft conversion or a new build property and needs to be given serious consideration from the beginning.   As part of the fully managed service we will take care of planning application submissions and subsequent dealings with the planning officer and make any necessary adjustments to reach a satisfactory conclusion. With the modular service you can choose to use us for this service or alternatively deal with some aspects of this process yourself.  Building Contract Administration   A key stage of any project is the build phase when your plans are turned into reality. Whether you choose to use us for a fully managed service or whether you have opted for a modular service we will be available to ensure you project is delivered to the highest standards.   If you have opted for the fully managed service we will act as the project co-ordinator and administrator ensuring suitable contractors are appointed, contracts are put in place and building work is being carried out to the highest standards. We carry out regular site visits to ensure any potential problems are dealt with quickly and sufficient detail is provided to builders when needed. We approve how much they will be paid each month, and check they are following the design drawings and documents. If you have opted for the modular service you can choose to select the necessary level of project management that you feel you need. All services will be available on a pay-as-you-go basis. Prior to every stage of work we carry out on the modular service we will quote how many hours we think a project is going to take.  Throughout the process from concept to finished project, Urbane Design will be there to help as much or as little as you want.  We are able to help you decide which level of service would be suitable for your project and budget."

We are owned and managed by two Partners, James McCosh and Meryl Townley, both of whom have worked for the practice for more than half their career. They share responsibilities, and architects work for both. Every project is led by one or more of the Partners, and the same team will see a project through from the early stages right through to the end.  The way in which we design buildings is more a reflection of the way in which we work with people, rather than an adherence to a particular ‘style’. Our key priorities are people, places and purpose.   We are convinced that good architecture can change lives for the better, but only if we have understood from the outset how a building will be used.  We take a holistic approach to design; we believe the development of any site is as much about the spaces between the buildings, as the buildings themselves.    We also concentrate on the acoustic qualities of spaces, not just where acoustic separation is important as in a school or performing venue. In our view acoustic design is as important as the distribution of light and the circulation of air, in creating the most physically and psychologically delightful environment."

The practice has broad experience, including in housing, office, retail, and hospitality sectors, and has worked on projects in the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand. The practice’s work is particularly indebted to the early-twentieth century Viennese modernist master architect Adolf Loos, on whose work William Tozer completed his doctorate at the Bartlett School of Architecture. William Tozer Associates understands architecture as compositions of abstract sculptural form and space, and discrete functional ‘furnishings’ at various scales. Each project curates and re-frames the context and history of its site, and captures the open-endedness of the processes of demolition and construction. The practice’s projects make sculptural compositions of volumes and planes, loosely dividing open-plan spaces into zones of use through their alignments and misalignments, changes of floor and ceiling level, and continuities and distinctions in the selection of materials, lighting, and other fixtures and fittings. Experiencing William Tozer Associates’ finished architectural projects gives users and viewers a sense of engagement with the processes of conception, demolition and construction that are usually erased—a form of ‘action architecture’, giving formal and spatial expression to contemporary craft processes, including writing and drawing."

Characteristic themes run through all project work: clarity of space - thoughtful use of natural light - a sense of order and calm - care in use of materials and the environment - carefully considered relationships between spaces, inside and out: whether a new house composed as a series of diverse interconnecting volumes focused on far reaching views - a city apartment reconfigured to maximise space - or a new environment for a personal collection of artefacts or books.   Christopher seeks to work closely with clients, and the wider construction team - a responsive and comprehensive service - assisting clients to realise the potential in their projects, regardless of type or budget.  Drawing from over 20 years experience in the design and delivery of buildings - large and small - services range from feasibility, concept design, through the planning process, to detail design, construction and completion on site.
